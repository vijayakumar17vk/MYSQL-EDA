# MYSQL-EDA
Hello, everyone! 
 After successfully completing my first project on data cleaning, Iâ€™m excited to share my second project focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL. 
 This project helped me gain deeper insights into layoff trends across industries and countries.

ðŸ”‘Key Highlights of My EDA Project:
 âœ… Data Selection: Queried relevant records using SELECT statements.
 âœ… Total & Percentage Laid Off: Used MAX() aggregate functions for better analysis.
 âœ… Time Analysis: Extracted start and end dates using MIN() & MAX() functions.
 âœ… Breakdown of Layoffs:
 ðŸ”¹ Company-wise, Industry-wise, Country-wise analysis.
 ðŸ”¹ Date & Month-wise trends.
 ðŸ”¹ Stage-wise layoffs for better business insights.
 âœ… Rolling Data Analysis with CTEs: Created cumulative records for country, industry, and company-wise layoffs.
 âœ… Company & Date-wise Layoffs: Analyzed layoffs over time for business impact.
ðŸ’¡ Key Learning: This project enhanced my skills in SQL queries, aggregate functions, CTEs, and time-based analysis.
